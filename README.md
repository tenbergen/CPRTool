# Calibrated Peer Review

A highly scalable web application that assists the process of coordinating and evaluating peer reviews of student work.

## Running the Project

This web application is made to be built on bare metal Linux environment using Docker. Make sure that the following software are installed:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

**Step 1:** Clone the repository.

**Step 2:** At the root of the directory, create a `.env` file using `.env.example` as the template and fill out the variables.

- Head to [Google Cloud Console Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) to create an `OAuth client ID`.
- Set the `Application type` as `Web application`. `Application name` can be anything.
- Add the full domain URL used in `.env` (with protocol and port if used) to `Authorized JavaScript origins` and `Authorized redirect URIs`. Save the changes.
- Copy and paste the `Client ID` and `Client secret` to your `.env` file as `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` respectively.

**Step 3:** Execute `sh build-app.sh` to build and start the Docker containers.

**Step 4:** In `scripts` directory, execute `mongo-init.sh` to initialize user database login credentials. This is only necessary on the very first build of the application.

The web application should be running on the specified domain in your `.env` file.

Optionally, in `scripts` directory:
- If you wish to change the user password, execute `mongo-changepwd.sh`. 
- To delete everything from all databases as well as saved files, execute `delete-db.sh`.

**Step 5:** To add users with elevated privileges (a.k.a professors), include the user's email on separate lines in `professor-list.txt`.

## Local Development Environment

For local development environment, a Docker setup is not necessary. Make sure that the following software and dependencies are installed:
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) >= 3.8.4
- [JDK](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/17/) >= 17
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) >= 5.0
- [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) is optional but recommended for a MongoDB GUI that also comes with a terminal for shell commands

**Step 1:** On Windows, hit `Windows + R`, enter `sysdm.cpl` and navigate to `Advanced -> Environment Variables...` and add the following variables:
| Variable         | Value       |
|------------------|-------------|
| `MONGO_HOSTNAME` | `localhost` |
| `MONGO_PORT`     | `27017`     |
| `MONGO_DATABASE` | `cpr`       |
| `MONGO_USERNAME` | Your choice |
| `MONGO_PASSWORD` | Your choice |

On Linux-based operating systems, you may achieve the similar result by executing `EXPORT <NAME>=<VALUE>`. 

**Step 2:** Using the MongoDB shell (either using MongoDB shell from terminal or the built-in one in MongoDB Compass) to create authentication for the database by running the following command:

- `db.createUser({user: "<your username>", pwd: "<your password>", roles: [{role: "readWrite", db: "cpr"}]});`

**Step 3:** Run `mvn liberty:dev` to start the project in developer mode. The web app should be running on http://localhost:xxxxx - the port depends on which microservice you are running as following:
| Microservice                     | Port    |
|----------------------------------|---------|
| `frontend`                       | `13125` |
| `login`                          | `13126` |
| `course-manager`                 | `13127` |
| `course-viewer`                  | `13128` |
| `peer-review-teams`              | `13129` |
| `professor-assignment`           | `13130` |
| `student-assignment`             | `13131` |
| `student-peer-review-assignment` | `13132` |

## Contributing

Contributors are more than welcome to improve the project by creating a new issue to report bugs, suggest new features, or make changes to the source code by making a pull request. To have your work merged in, please make sure the following is done:

1. If you are not a contributor, fork the repository and create your branch from master. Otherwise, create a new development branch with a desired name.
2. Push your commits to the aforementioned fork/branch. 
3. Make sure to keep the changes within the scope of the pull request you are about to make, as it is highly disencouraged to commit irrelevant changes that does not have anything to do with the pull request.
4. Create a pull request.
5. If you’ve fixed a bug or added something new, add a comprehensive list of changes. Ensure that your code is tested, functional, and is linted.
6. When merging into master, it is highly recommended that you choose "squash and merge" instead of the default option "create a merge commit" to prevent flooding the master branch's commit history.
